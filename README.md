## About Some Decisions in the Project

1. **Single HTML File:** 
   - It is generally a bad idea to make all pages' content in one HTML file, as it leads to a significant increase in page download time. However, this was done due to customer requirements.
2. **Guest Room Page:** 
   - The guest room page allows anyone to add any number of comments, which can lead to a cluttered and unmanageable interface. This was also a demand of the customer.
